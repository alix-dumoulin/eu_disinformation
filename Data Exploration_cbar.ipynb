As for claiming that Sputnik Estonia is a mouthpiece of Russian propaganda, I have to say that all our [Estonian] biggest newspapers, radio and TV channels are mouthpieces of Estonian propaganda. The main question is whether the propaganda is based on truth or lie or deliberate lie. I repeat, I have not heard of a lie coming from Sputnik. The Estonian authorities are not accusing Sputnik [Estonia] of lying.\",\"We regard the actions of the regime in Estonia towards its citizens as public persecution, anarchy in the rule of law, indication of totalitarism and a gross infringement on the principles of freedom of speech unprecedented in the EU. The journalists were only guilty for working for Russian media.\",\"The only thing we are guilty of is the fact that we are journalists working for an outlet independent of any government. While we fight for the right to continue our work, we also fight for the rights of readers in Estonia and abroad to access the full spectrum of information.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is called freedom of speech, that, sadly, is missing in Estonia today, despite the fact that according to Reporters without borders, our country is fit for 11th place in the Press freedom index.\",\"Using the enormous archive of trophy documents Putin has proved two crucial points: first, on the eve of the World War II Poland basically formed a military alliance with Hitler's Germany and secondly, anti-antisemitism became a state ideology of Poland before the war. This means that Poland, together with Nazi Germany, is the culprit of starting World War II.\",\"This is the persecution, the real persecution, which is now being conducted against not only the Sputnik Estonia, but specifically, every employee who goes to work. Sputnik Estonia's reporters did not violate the laws of the country and professional ethics.\",\"Ukraine does not want to buy gas for the needs of the population from Russia due to the fact that Ukrainian politicians want to maintain full control over Ukraine's gas market.\",\"Ukraine allowed citizenship to be issued to murderers and punishers.\",\"NATO has begun preparations for a full-scale war against Russia. NATO is getting ever closer to Russia and increasing its presence along Russian borders in order to draw the Kremlin into World War III.\",\"Great Britain finds Ukraine guilty in its dispute with Russia over outstanding Eurobonds: the $3 billion that ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych borrowed from the Kremlin in 2013.\",\"The Estonians would never have decided on such illegal actions if they didn't have permission from their real owners in the West. Without the coordination with NATO allies, the USA, this situation would not have developed in such a shameful way. Moreover, representatives of NATO and the EU will cover up the actions of the Estonian authorities.\",\"The decision of WADA is illegal and unreasonable. Therefore, it should be objectively examined by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). On a formal far-fetched pretext, the status of RUSADA was temporarily suspended.\\u00a0\",\"Four officers of Ukraine's Security Service were killed near the town of Vinohradiv in Transcarpathia close to the border with Hungary.\",\"US satellites were supposed to \\u201csee\\u201d the moment of the crash of MH17, however, the information received was classified. And no one really recalls it now.\",\"Venezuela\\u2019s National Assembly decided to suspend several opposition lawmakers, allegedly involved in receiving bribes to whitewash and save businessmen from economic sanctions imposed by the US. As a consequence of these accusations, those opposition lawmakers even pointed at Juan Guaid\\u00f3.\",\"Italy and Western societies, in general, are increasingly dominated by childish and stupid people and are hostile to values such as courage, loyalty and ardor. This type of individual, which is increasingly common in the West in all social classes, political parties and religions, repeats empty slogans and platitudes, rejects war and is convinced that he is the vanguard of a new society.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Italy, individuals with these characteristics are selling off the country to foreigners and are unaware of the consequences of their actions.\",\"The recent European Parliament resolution which equates Communism and Nazism and claims that the Soviet Union was also responsible for the outbreak of World War II is pure madness. Countries in Europe and North America are attempting to subvert historical facts and to distort the course of events that lead to the Second World War.\",\"According to the European legislative body, the Republic of Moldova is a territorial formation created by the Soviet Union on the land that it took from Romania. And this land has not yet been returned to Bucharest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European Parliament de facto requires the liquidation of the state of the Republic of Moldova. This is recorded in an official document.\",\"Washington understands how bad is for NATO\\u2019s image if Turkey leaves. Both the Alliance and Turkey are extremely necessary, in the context of a clash of interests with Russia and China. But, first of all, the Americans need the block in order to keep the Europeans under their tight control.\",\"Any critic of the EU is considered a \\u201cpolitically incorrect\\u201d dissenter from dominant globalist thinking and is subjected to media persecution.\\r\\n\\r\\nA recent example is the Italian cartoonist Mario Improta (known as Marione), who published a cartoon depicting British prime minister Boris Johnson escaping the EU, portrayed as the Auschwitz concentration camp. Improta was named and shamed by the mainstream media, who claimed that his cartoon inappropriately used the Holocaust in political satire. As a result, he lost his appointment as cartoonist for the Rome city government\\u2019s civic education campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the real reason why Improta was subjected to media persecution was because he dared to question the sacredness of the European Union and thus expressed a view that dissented from dominant, \\u201cpolitically correct\\u201d globalist thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlobalist cartoonists, instead, are allowed to freely use nazism, fascism and racism in political satire aimed at discrediting the political right.

Russia's foes are concerned about its prospects because it can potentially result in a post-Soviet reunification. Hence, the key tool of political war against the Russian World is Russophobia, i.e. a hostile attitude and hatred towards any Russian manifestations in the whole post-Soviet space. In Belarus, Russophobia is aimed at radically distorting the national consciousness of Belarusians. Its main tool is a doctrine of Polishness which presents Belarusian history through the lens of Polish-Catholic interests. The objective of the Polishness doctrine is not to turn Belarusians into Poles, although this scenario cannot be ruled out, but rather to change their cultural and civil belonging, to cultivate a hostile attitude towards Russia and the Russian World and to tear Belarus away from Russia. The competing civilisation project can be named the 4th Rzezhpospolita.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolishness and Belarusianness bring a threat to the integration processes in the post-Soviet space and to Belarus itself. We talk about the threat of transforming Belarus into a Russophobic and anti-Russian country. In Belarus, Russophobia is presented in three formats. First, the openly anti-Russian propaganda of the Association of Belarusian Language and other similar groupings. Second, pro-European parties which hide their pathological hatred of Russia under European values. They always paint Russia in a black light and present it as the source of evil on the planet, their activities are based on U.S. and EU instruments. Third, the Russophobia of Belarusian officials, the most dangerous type of Russophobia. A number of state bodies and universities for humanities are its representatives.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll three types of Russophobia have a common objective: to take away the all-Russian basis of national consciousness from Belarusians, to turn Belarusians into haters of Russia, to create a ground for disrupting the Russian-Belarusian union, to revoke the Treaty on the Union State between Belarus and Russia, and to turn Belarus into anti-Belarus.\",\"Latest U.S. and Polish activities, including speeches of American experts at Minsk conference and an information campaign of subordinated Belarusian media, indicate that they aim at provoking strict Russian countermeasures and pushing it to the conflict with Belarus.
