# Disinfo Horizon: Responding to Future Threats

Hackathon on disinformation, Brussels 29-30 January.

## Initial Ideas

* Check if link is in database - bot to highlight it as fake news. Simulation analysis. Maybe Twitter bot.

* Visualization has great potential for awareness / insights. 

* Word vectorization and visualization. Maybe a Shiny dashboard to search, a network to see how they related and how the news relate to each other.

Steps

1) pick a few axis to focus on (aka. insight outcomes e.g. "which news sources connect?"

2) get the data

3) decide on an outcome (interface, product)

4) distribute tasks and get to work
