# Disinfo Horizon: Responding to Future Threats

Hackathon on disinformation, Brussels 29-30 January.

## Steps taken

1) Collected the data using the API (https://api.veedoo.io) - wrote them as .csv and .json

2) Decided on 3 main axes to explore

3) Decided on an outcome / interface


## The idea

### The big picture

A network analysis of the meta data to gain a broad idea of what the data is. This might include network analysis of organisations and the keywords they share.

### The Explorer

Based on word embedding and other quantitative text analysis methods, the user can explore word similarity and frequency in the data. This might include a search tool for a word which would output the other similar words and plot this.

### The Action

Using text similarity measures, the user could measure the similarity of an article with fake news articles.
